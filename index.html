                <p> I watched this dog for like 6 weeks before adopting him. I wanted to name him
                  Winter, but I never could make the change from his original, Cecil. He had a bad
                attitude and I was scared to have such a fearsome dog as my first pet. He
                however, has been one of the greatest dogs I've known. He is 6 years old.</p>

                <p> The Great Protector found Albert. He is such a snuggler, however, he wasn't always, so.
                He used to scratch and swipe at me all the time. When I moved he thought he was going to be
                left behind and showed signs of severe depression. He was the last to be moved to the new
                location, however, when he realised he wasn't being left behind, he became the best kitty ever!</p>

                <p> This babe is the best baby. She never gets upset, even when she's in trouble for stuff.
                She keeps me entertained and I can't stay sad or upset about anything when she's around.To bring about
                all these year's of happiness for &lt$1000, she was well worth it.</p>
